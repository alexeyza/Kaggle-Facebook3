#Kaggle Facebook Recruiting III - Keyword Extraction

This repository includes my scripts for the Kaggle [Facebook Recruiting III - Keyword Extraction](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction) competition. My solution is based on [Alex Minnaar's blog post](http://alexminnaar.com/2013/09/14/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction-part-1/).

##Instructions
* The `model` folder includes the following scripts: `pre_process.py` which prepares the training and testing files, `classification_model_mongodb.py` which creates association rules and creates the prediction output.
* In addition, you will need to create a `csv` directory and copy the data files in there ([download data csv files here](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data)).

##Suggestions
I would appreciate any suggestions you may have regarding improving the scripts. My current best [public score](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/leaderboard) on Kaggle is 0.39272.
